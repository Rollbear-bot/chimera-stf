# Chimera-SMF

This repository implements the Chimera Shared Matrix Factorizantion (over Time)
technique, first introduced in the paper "Temporally Evolving Community Detection
and Prediction in Content-Centric Networks".

This algorithm can simultaneously account for graph links, content, and temporal
analysis by extracting the latent semantic structure of the network in
multidimensional form, but in a way that takes into account the temporal
continuity of these embeddings.

The code in this repo implements the loss function

Once optimization converges or time runs out, it will save the learning
embeddings in their own files.
